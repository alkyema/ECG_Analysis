# ECG Anomaly Detection using 12-Lead Heart Readings

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in ECG signals using 12-lead heart readings. By leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model, the system is trained to identify irregularities in ECG data that may indicate potential health concerns. The goal is to create a reliable, efficient, and accurate solution for medical professionals to assist in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.

## Key Features
- **12-Lead ECG Data Input**: Processes input from a standard 12-lead ECG machine.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implements a CNN-based model for anomaly detection.
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized for precise identification of anomalies.
- **User-Friendly Output**: Clear classification of results for easier interpretation.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle large datasets and multiple use cases.

## Dataset
The project uses 12-lead ECG data, which includes recordings of the electrical activity of the heart from multiple perspectives. Ensure that the dataset:
- Contains labeled normal and anomalous ECG signals.
- Is preprocessed to handle noise and inconsistencies.

Sample sources for datasets:
- [PhysioNet MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/)
- Kaggle ECG Datasets

## Model Architecture
The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to:
1. Extract features from raw ECG signal data.
2. Detect patterns and irregularities within the ECG readings.
3. Classify results into normal or anomalous categories.

### Key Components:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial and temporal features from ECG waveforms.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality to focus on the most critical features.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform the final classification of the data.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecg-anomaly-detection.git
   cd ecg-anomaly-detection
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place your ECG dataset in the `data/` directory.
4. Run the preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
5. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
6. Test the model:
   ```bash
   python test_model.py
   ```

## Results
The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting ECG anomalies. Evaluation metrics include:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**

Visualization of results, such as confusion matrix and ROC curve, is provided in the `results/` directory.

## Usage
1. Upload an ECG file in the required format.
2. Run the anomaly detection script:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input_file path/to/ecg_file
   ```
3. The script will output a classification result, indicating whether the ECG signal is normal or anomalous.
